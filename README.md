# Space Shooter Game - Project04

Unfortunately, I was not able to get this game to work correctly and apologize for the glitches. 

This is a full but simple space shooter game created in Godot for a C220 Game Technology class at Indiana University using GDScript. The game is comprised of a ship which the user controls WASD and spacebar to shoot. The user must performs actions such as shooting down enemy ships and avoiding space obstacles of meteors to score points while avoiding death by enemy.
